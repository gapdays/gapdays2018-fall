## Possible topics and projects

### some old topics

The following are some topics from past GAP days. If you'd like to
revisit one of these, or some other subject, please contact the organizers.

3. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
4. __MatrixObj__ (continue work from the [previous GAP Days](http://gapdays.de/gapdays2017-spring/10_topic/))
5. __Documentation, Tutorials, Accessibility__ (talk about how to improve them, and ideally also actually do that)
6. __Website__ (we probably need to a completely new one; can we hire somebody to do it? what is needed? etc.)
4. __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))
2. __Proper package namespaces in GAP__ Max has some ideas...
