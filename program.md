<!--
The focus of the workshop will be on presenting research and development related to GAP. __Please submit proposals__ (e.g., topics you want to see covered, or title of a talk you could give) to the organisers (<gapdays2017-fall@gapdays.de>).
-->

## Possible topics

1. __Towards GAP 4.10__
2. ... ???

### some old topics we may wish to add to the agenda again...

3. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
4. __MatrixObj__ (continue work from the [previous GAP Days](http://gapdays.de/gapdays2017-spring/10_topic/))
5. __Documentation, Tutorials, Accessibility__ (talk about how to improve them, and ideally also actually do that)
6. __Website__ (we probably need to a completely new one; can we hire somebody to do it? what is needed? etc.)
4. __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))
2. __Proper package namespaces in GAP__ Max has some ideas...

If you have any suggestions for the code sprint, please let the organisers know or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues) using the label "gapdays2017-fall".
