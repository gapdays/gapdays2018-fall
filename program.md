## Topics and projects

1. __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))

2. __Towards GAP 4.10__ (the `stable-4.10` branch is planned for September 1st, and GAP 4.10.0 for October 1st; during the GAP days, we can finish the overview of changes in GAP 4.10, and if necessary fix any last minute regressions)


### Further topics

The following are some topics from past GAP days. If you'd like to
revisit one of these, or some other subject, please contact the organizers.

1. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
2. __MatrixObj__ (continue work from the [previous GAP Days](https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2017-spring/10_topic/))
3. __Documentation, Tutorials, Accessibility__ (talk about how to improve them, and ideally also actually do that)
4. __Website__ (we probably need to a completely new one; can we hire somebody to do it? what is needed? etc.)

Some other possibly ideas for topics:

6. __Proper package namespaces in GAP__ Max has some ideas...
7. __Package manager for GAP__ (Dima, ...)
8. __Implement `make install`__ (Max, ...)
9. __Metapackages for GAP distribution__ (See https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/2267)			
10. ... your idea here ???
