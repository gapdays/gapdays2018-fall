<!--
The focus of the workshop will be on presenting research and development related to GAP. __Please submit proposals__ (e.g., topics you want to see covered, or title of a talk you could give) to the organisers (<gapdays2017-fall@gapdays.de>).

## Code sprint
* Start: Monday September 4th at 10:00 am
* Finish: Friday September 8th afternoon

- All days:
  - 10:00 Begin
  
  - 12:00 - 13:00: *Lunch (in-house Mensa)*
  
  - 15:00 - 15:30: *Tee, coffee, and cake*

  - 17:00 - 18:00 Status report

- Wednesday:
  - 13:45:         __Group photo__ (we will meet in room D-201 and move from there)
  
  - 19:00:         Code sprint dinner at [Trattoria Gianni & Giulia](http://trattoria-gianni-giulia.de/?page_id=35).

The primary focus of the code sprint will be on the following topics:

1. __GAP - HPC-GAP integration__
  - see the [the HPC-GAP TODO wiki page](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/wiki/HPC-GAP-TODO) for specifics
2. __Towards GAP 4.9__
  - work on a release check list (see [this issue](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/1477))
  - fix open issues, merged PRs, ...
  - prepare a list of major/minor changes since GAP 4.8
  - if possible, prepare the actual release

Some ideas for secondary topics (may or may not be worked on):

3. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
4. __MatrixObj__ (continue work from the [previous GAP Days](http://gapdays.de/gapdays2017-spring/10_topic/))
5. __Documentation, Tutorials, Accessibility__ (talk about how to improve them, and ideally also actually do that)
6. __Website__ (we probably need to a completely new one; can we hire somebody to do it? what is needed? etc.)
4. __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))

If you have any suggestions for the code sprint, please let the organisers know or [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues) using the label "gapdays2017-fall".


#### Please also look at [the Wiki for details](https://github.com/gapdays/gapdays2017-fall/wiki). Feel free to add pages there relevant to the workshop or code sprint.

#### Tasks

There is now an editable list of tasks where you can see how to help and register your progress. Please contact us for the link.

#### Weekend
There are currently no specific plans for the weekend (September 2nd & 3rd). For those staying over the weekend, access to the university will be available.
