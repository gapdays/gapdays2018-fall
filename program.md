## Topics and projects

1. __GAP - Julia integration__ (continue work from [Oscar GAP Kickoff Coding Sprint (restricted access)](https://github.com/oscar-system/OSCAR/wiki/Oscar-GAP-Kickoff-Coding-Sprint))

2. __Towards GAP 4.10__ (the `stable-4.10` branch is planned for September 1st, and GAP 4.10.0 for October 1st; during the GAP days, we can finish the overview of changes in GAP 4.10, and if necessary fix any last minute regressions)

3. __libGAP__ (access GAP as a library, for use in SageMath, OSCAR and elsewhere; for details, please read this [email by Markus Pfeiffer](https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2018-August/001123.html))

4. __Metapackages for GAP distribution__ (for details, read this [pull request](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/2267))


### Further topics

The following are some topics from past GAP days, and suggestion for
new things. If you'd like to revisit one of these, or some other subject, please contact the organizers. However, we would like to avoid opening up too many different
topics, and instead focus on a few selected ones.

1. __Data structures in GAP__ (providing stacks, queues, hash sets, hash maps, ...; see also <https://github.com/gap-packages/datastructures>)
2. __MatrixObj__ (continue work from the [previous GAP Days](https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2017-spring/10_topic/))
3. __Documentation, Tutorials, Accessibility__ (talk about how to improve them, and ideally also actually do that)
4. __Website__ (we probably need to a completely new one; can we hire somebody to do it? what is needed? etc.)
5. __Package manager for GAP__ (Dima, ...)
6. __Implement `make install`__ (Max, ...)
7. ... your idea here ???
