## GAP in general

[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to influence the future
development of GAP. To streamline each meeting the organizers usually suggest a few
main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in core GAP
and packages via short talks. However, the focus of the meeting is on code
development, with talks only playing a minor role.
As enough GAP experts will be around for technical support, the
meetings offer good opportunities for people to work on their own
packages. At the end of the week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.
